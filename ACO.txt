ACO ( Ant colony optimization)

concept

Ant leave pheromones (chemical ) on path .
other ant follows stronger  pheromones path
shorter path = more pheromones quickly = more ants follows it 
best path wins



stigmergy

Indirect communication through environment.
Ant don't talk - they use pheromones trails.
After many iteration - shortest path remains.


key points:
1)   pheromone evaporation rate(p):
     small p(delta)= slow change
     large P(delta) = Fast change 

2)   Best for : path problems,routing ,scheduling 

     Example  : Travelling Salesman
     problem(TSP) - finds shortest city tour

     Ants + pheromones + shortest path  = ACO
